Wakey-Wakey, the meaning of the name refers to "vigor/upward/enthusiasm" of contemporary young people, but the characters of our NFTs are all "lying flat".

It ridicules the difficulty of class mobility caused by the fixed social class and the intensification of social problems, which was made out of disappointment with the real environment in the context of "instead of following social expectations and persevering in struggle, it is better to choose 'lie down' and have no desires and no desires". attitude. Seen as a way to combat social "involution".

Another meaning is that more young people learn about crypto, a kind of awakening to new things, embrace changes, refresh their cognition, and find their own broader world.
